                        With such expansive and ubiquitous applications of computationally-driven technology, it is necessary that Computer Scientists have a critical understanding of the societal implications of their work. Technology and computational thinking imparts an overwhelming and consequential influence within various aspects of the human experience, on both societal and personal dimensions – including how we constitute human progress, how we build values and goals, and how underlying ideologies and assumptions about who we are as human beings drive our orientations and actions. As much as technological innovation has enriched the scope of human civilization’s capabilities, from digitally-mediated communication, accessibility of information/education, to innovations within medicine and health, computational applications have also been used as a mechanism to sustain monopolizations of power, and in turn, accelerate social oppression around the world – often in implicit ways, obscured under ostensibly positively intentions to augment the reach and scale of production through automation. However, the epistemological nature and computational processes that construct technological applications have been proven to be imbued with biases along axioms of race and gender, and other categorical identities that branch out of them.</div>

                        CS as a discipline and field is and has been rapidly evolving in the kinds of values, interests, and issues that centers the field, with increasing levels of novelty and specialization. However, what has remained consistent through the general course of its existence is how the field has been centered around whiteness, ableness, masculinity, and heteronormativity within neoliberal capitalism. The implications of its epistemic ontology is one that has been and remains a tool for various dimensions of oppression.</div>

                        I argue that epistemology, values, and motivations within computational knowledge and applications dominate – often in chauvinistic and reductionist ways – how we understand the world, how we identify and solve societal problems, and how we dictate processes within civilization. Such thinking is explicitly and implicitly upheld in CS education: how we understand the tool of computation is reflected in the underlying conceptual structures and teaching practices as well as the people who have access to and are represented in its teachings. This is to reflect on the sociopolitical dimensions of CS education, inquiring its purpose and what kinds of people it ultimately serves. Thus, to imagine a radical orientation of CS education that aligns with movements of justice</div>

                        and liberation, is to expand the profile of CS education that welcomes a diversity of students (especially Black and brown students and gender minorities) and to include a variety of epistemologies, frameworks, and voices that contribute to the enrichment of how CS can transform its greater meaning. This requires more than learning about the technical components of CS; it demands critical inquiry and careful implementation strategies on how to ensure that their product will not reinforce societal inequities. While social and ethical implications of computer science have been increasing in par with the rapid applications of technology, and scholarship studying these issues have also been rising as a legitimized area of study (e.g. Science Technology Studies), the nature of academic institutional bureaucracy has been evolving much slower to integrate these forms of pedagogy within their institutions. This is also attributed to the fact that because CS academia continues to be heavily dominated by white, cis, men, there has been resistance from institutions and faculty to recognize and act upon the merits of integrating these fields of study. My research focuses on CS education within Swarthmore College’s CS department. Given the necessity of integrating social and ethical oriented teachings of CS, my thesis articulates the ongoing work and the various challenges of justice-driven pedagogical reform within the department. My research aims to explore this inquiry by analyzing the underlying norms, values and purpose of existing curricula, and the institutional and bureaucratic mechanisms that drive the upkeep and evolution of the department, while centering the perspectives of its marginalized constituents.

This challenges dominant conceptions of knowledge, especially scientific knowledge, that ostensibly mends the limitations brought by incertitude and subjectivity. However, knowledge as static and incontestable is not a universally accepted idea, nor should it be. Such an orientation is a product of Western civilization and hegemony– whose origins can be traced back to the Enlightenment period, characterized by the insurgence of scientific practice and thought, where knowledge was understood to be based on logic, empiricism, and perhaps most saliently, regarded as singular and objective (Pukshanskii, 2016). However, non-Western modes of knowledge, including various Indigenous ways of thinking for example, construct context-sensitive knowledge derived from perceptive observations, oral and written history and are informed by Indigenous values of intergenerational relationality, community, spirituality and environmental nurtureship and sustainability (Chilisa, 2012). Such formations of knowledge are adaptable and dynamic.

To adhere to a singular worldview or to take an epistemology whole without considering its flaws or contradictions is a kind of ideological conformity and supremacy veiled under the legitimization of objective and singular conceptions of knowledge. Then, the conception that knowledge is apolitical can be quickly disputed by the historical implications of knowledge, particularly science, falsely leveraged to uphold and justify Western hegemony. Because the differentiatedness of knowledge is a key driver in unequal distributions of power and hegemonic sustenance, to understand, critique, and dismantle oppressive structures relies on critical inquiries of how knowledge is constructed, under what conditions, and who it benefits. Paulo Freire, in his seminal work Pedagogy of the Oppressed, developed the idea of ‘critical consciousness’ – to understand the world through its social and political contradictions for the purpose of changing it for the better (Freire, 1970).

More often than not, classrooms and curricula are structured through one-sided, passive forms of learning, where students are told what to think. To disrupt traditional STEM teachings and learning methods is to argue for a fundamental restructuring of STEM education that establishes a sociological basis to its curriculum. Moreover, it is to understand the mechanism and behaviors of academic institutions, an expansive system legitimizing and forefronting specific modes of knowledge and learning, as a political conduct.

Consequently, students who started as and pursued a STEM major have been shown to have “significantly lower social agency outcomes” often attributed to STEM industry norms and environmental pressures from college and family (Garibay, 2015, pg. 623). Underrepresented STEM students of color have been shown to value social change more than their non-underrepresented counterparts. However, because socially-conscious STEM education and practice is not the dominant paradigm embodied in higher education, such students often have to make decisions to “either conform to the dominant disciplinary culture or to find ways to harbor her or his values of making a difference without critical departmental support” (Garibay, 2015, pg. 627). Thus, the dominant economic-centered framework of pedagogy and knowledge can create inequities on who succeeds within STEM.

Curricula and organizational standards, missions and goals deeply shape students’ attitudes, values and relationships with social responsibility, and it is under the prerogative and responsibility of faculty to instantiate such reforms. (Vreeland & Bidwell, 1966).

Such an approach would ostensibly prepare liberal arts computer science students to apply their knowledge across various subfields and computational applications post-graduation despite the relatively limited amount of computer science courses taken within a student’s undergraduate program. However, aside from the aforementioned identifying traits of a liberal arts computer science curriculum, I want to draw attention to other distinguishing attributes a liberal arts computer science education other than its focus on theoretical principles.

For example, Swarthmore College’s mission statement explicitly states their curriculum “[connects] the arts, humanities, natural sciences and </p>

Although relatively few liberal arts graduates may enter a computing profession, many liberal arts graduates will be making policy decisions and taking leadership roles within a democratic society. All of these people need to understand opportunities and issues related to technology; they need insights to understand implications and to ask appropriate questions....People well-educated in the liberal arts with some knowledge of computer science are needed to help decide what computers ought to do.” (Walker H. and Keleman C., 2010, pg. 7)”</p>

An advantage of having a well-rounded education ensures the practicality and applicability of their education to avoid “committing to a knowledge base that might not be relevant tomorrow.” (Why liberal arts, 2022) This motive supports the college’s “commitment to peace, equity and social responsibility” — to use a liberal arts education to engage with a society with ever-changing values and needs (Mission, 2023). Such institutional goals and missions should be reflected within every academic department’s own missions and values.”

                                        <p style = "margin: 0 0 1em;">Keleman was a co-author to the 2010 publication, “Computer Science and the Liberal Arts: A Philosophical Examination” that explained how the field of computer science benefits from computer science thinkers who received a liberal arts education. In particular, the paper discusses the importance of learning social science epistemologies that explore the benefits and harms of computational applications in society.

I argue that such a skill is becoming increasingly more important in today’s society where widespread applications of computation have been noted to produce racial and gendered algorithmic biases (Beer, 2016). With an increased prevalence in wide-reaching applications of computer science, the 2007 LACS model curriculum had one paragraph that touched upon social and ethical issues in computer science within a list of curriculum considerations common to many courses. The paper even recommends that an introductory course allocate five hours of instruction to “History, social, ethical issues” (LACS, 2007, pg. 7).

The 2007 Model Curriculum recommends that specific social/ethical issues be discussed in connection with related technical issues, to show students that the two are not separable. For example, units on testing or proof should discuss the professional’s responsibility to produce correct code; topics such as the Internet or cryptography will be presented as applications of course concepts, and those presentations include discussions of the social impact of the applications on areas such as privacy, accuracy, and security.” (LACS, 2007, pg. 7)</p>
                                        <p style = "margin: 0 0 1em;">concerns into the courses are not currently reflected within Swarthmore College’s department. The lack of robust integrations of social and ethics based curricula does not mean that the department does not find such issues important to teach, rather, it reflects the struggles within institutional bureaucracy and faculty bandwidth to robustly and effectively implement these standards into the department. Such struggles stem from various factors – to understand them is to understand the institutional context to which these changes are being implemented.

The study “Debating Diversity and Social Justice Curricular Requirements: How Organizational Culture at a Liberal Arts College Informed the Change Process” described the challenges and outcomes of an institutional-wide diversity course reform at a southern Liberal Arts College. The study had defined a diversity course as a course that addresses the history of different dimensions of social oppression, explores contemporary issues of social oppression, invokes critical introspection into students’ own history and experiences, and engages in methodologies and practices in working towards social justice (Miller, R. A., & Holliday-Millard, P., 2021). The study had articulated 1) the particular components of an effective diversity course, 2) measuring the efficacy of the diversity courses, and 3) the institutional challenges in introducing a wide course reform and its relationship with the organizational culture of the institution (Miller, R. A., & Holliday-Millard, P., 2021).

A., & Holliday-Millard, P., 2021). Thus, the faculty committee in charge of this new initiative designated specific requirements that would ensure a more productive diversity curriculum.</div>

Students of color/marginalized students should also positively benefitting from the course – understanding their positionalities situated within different logic of their own privileges and marginalities, the intricacies of social oppression and intersectional consolidation —that goes beyond students of color/marginalized students’ understandings of power and injustice from their own experience and doesn’t rely on students of color/marginalized students educating non-marginalized students in the classroom.</div>
                                <div style = "font-size: clamp(9px, 0.8vw, 12px); text-align: justify; margin: 1em;">The study utilized Tierney’s organizational framework in understanding how institutional culture informs how curricular reform is implemented within an institution. In understanding how to navigate introducing curricular reform, the faculty committee of the diversity course reform utilized Tierney’s framework to construct application strategies and to address areas of resistance. More specifically, this was to understand the “existing environment and mission of the organization to “work” the structure and introduce change, and with this information and strategy, ... provide informal leadership and navigate politics in the organization.” (Miller, R. A., & Holliday-Millard, P., 2021, p. 1102). Questions were then formed through Tierney’s framework on how to develop a reform process successfully (Miller, R. A., & Holliday-Millard, P., 2021). Such questions informed this thesis’s faculty interview protocols, in understanding the process of measuring department efficacy and introducing reform operates within Swarthmore College CS department, and how broader institutional infrastructures and culture informed such processes.</div>

                                I conducted interviews with two recent student alumni of Swarthmore’s Computer Science department. As much as my thesis is centered around social and ethical conscious CS pedagogy, I was not directly looking for participants that have engaged with this kind of work/thinking during their time at Swarthmore. <br><br>Rather, the underlying purpose of the student alumni interviews was to understand how institutional and curricular norms of the department affect how students formed their interests, values and pursuits as computer scientists. The interview questions generally covered #1) their experience within the CS department and how it affects what they do currently and their general career pursuits, #2) what, if any, aspects of Computer Science education absent from their computer science experience might have been beneficial to see within the department and #3) how their self-identities and/or values affected their responses.

I was like “how am I ever going to use this with a community, a future community, or a future company, or anything that?” … And so I think the only difference with CS was that it seemed a little bit more, say, skill based and maybe I could apply, for example, this specific coding knowledge into a future job and whatnot.

Generally, the faculty interviews would gauge CS faculty’s perspectives on (1) departmental process on evaluating its efficacy in alignment with the department’s goals/missions and introducing change/reform within the department (2) their personal experiences and perspectives of integrating and teaching socially and ethically conscious pedagogy in their respective courses, and (3) what the departmental conversations and/or personal opinions on integrating more robust and long-lasting social and ethical considerations in CS classes have looked like and currently look like.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>One striking commonality between Student A and Student B’s experiences were the scant retention and relevance of their CS coursework within their post-graduate CS jobs. Both students, having participated in tech internships during their undergraduate studies, claimed that those experiences most shaped what kind of work they pursued, where they garnered the relevant skills that informed their full-time work.  However, both students felt that the lab work within their CS classes were in most part, situated within isolated, abstract contexts, and given that most labs were done in a two week period, they were not able to see the greater purpose of their lab work or the necessary contextualization needed to understand the cohesion of all their labs long-term. Because courses at Swarthmore mostly cover various foundational components of CS, it naturally cannot ensure direct applicability to a particular CS job/work – given it operates under specific technical and working environments based on the nature of the team/company’s project that may be very different from the environments they were used to during their undergrad.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Both students preferred project-based labs, where students had the agency to utilize their CS knowledge to pursue something that aligned with their passions, and having the experience to work with groups of three and more. They found that collaborative work experiences within their CS work motivated them to seek that out within their workplaces. Student B even went on to say that if she did not have thorough experiences with collaborative work, she may have been hesitant to seek out the guidance and opinions of her team members or manager.  Student B brought up ideas of having more project-based labs that collaborated with local businesses or companies, engaging in CS outside of the “Swat and education bubble”, where their work would hold greater value than just within academia. Student B particularly appreciated her Machine Learning (ML) course where they were to engage only with the concepts of ML, but also focused on the ethical implications of ML and CS in general. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>They also believed in the importance of socially and ethically conscious work for personal as well as professional reasons and wished more of those discussions were part of their CS experience at Swarthmore. For Student B, such conversations were important for work in industry, and wished that the CS faculty who had experience working in industry would leverage their insights into their curriculum, and wished for more community and research based projects of more than two people that built upon each other, instead of having distinct, individual labs.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The aforementioned significance of social and ethical components of CS curricula indicates its inseparable necessity within the CS curriculum models, especially within application-based components of the curriculum. This is to redefine and renegotiate what LACS asserted as their definition of CS, which served as the basis of their model curriculum. It is their failure to consider how “needs and priorities of particular technologies”, of which social and ethical CS pedagogy falls under, is interdependent with how “scientific principles” of CS is defined. The reluctance to integrate the social impact of computation within its pedagogy is to question what its curriculum ultimately seeks to serve. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>It must be said that the CS department within its pedagogical practices uphold the dominant disciplinary values and practices of CS without no direct intention of undervaluing the interests and voices of underrepresented students, but with the intention of preparing CS students to succeed post-graduate by forefronting the knowledge and practice required for skills-based work that are most in demand. As Section III of the literature review notes, the CS department’s missions never explicitly state having social considerations and ethical practices as a pedagogical goal, and are geared towards ensuring proficiency of CS as a concrete, scientific practice forefronting fundamental principles of theoretical, systems, and applications and their interrelatedness, problem-solving, and teamwork. While the student interviewees had noted differences between their coursework and their industry work, it must be noted that both lab assignments within the classroom and work in industry often follow the model of a manager/teacher assigning an objective which workers/students must accomplish through code, often not making way for other aspects of critically engaging in CS – something that Student A had experienced in both the classroom and in the workplace.

Faculty B also mentioned how they utilize external resources, like literature from ACM, to discern other aspects they should consider when evaluating the department.

                                        <li>At the beginning of each academic year, the department collectively decides one goal to tackle for the school year and at the end of the academic term, the department concludes the assessment and writes a report on it. Goals can range in their specificity; Faculty A mentioned how one year the department assessed the efficacy of the course groupings for upper-level courses and whether students successfully retained key concepts from all group categories. Other years, the department picked more specific goals – focusing on unit testing, assessing for example, whether unit testing practices were being taught in ways that increased students’ ability to understand coding and debugging processes better. The more comprehensive and robust departmental assessment happens every 10 years, where the department must conduct an extensive self-study report of the whole department, and give it to three to five external examiners who visit the college and relay different solutions of improving the department. Both faculty acknowledged the importance of student feedback as well, although aside from informal conversations with students, it has been some time since a department-wide student survey was performed or the last time the department conducted an exit survey for graduating seniors of the department. The faculty also make critical observations in the classroom to discern student receptions of departmental and/or curricular practices.

                                        <li>When asked how the department identifies their goals and areas of improvement, the impression from both responses indicated that finding areas of improvement weren’t the issue, but finding the time and bandwidth to adequately address them. Faculty A particularly noted that “one of our overarching goals that's constantly on the top of our minds is diversity, equity, and inclusion” and mentioned the Advisory Council to the CS Department (ACCS) program that started after the rise of the BLM, where the results of a department-wide student survey showed that marginalized students in CS felt less sense of belonging and ability to succeed in the department. Faculty A also relayed that the Ninja program, paid CS tutors that help students in the introductory and intermediate courses were also designed with DEI in mind. Relatedly, Faculty B expressed sentiments about how critical curriculum assessment is something that the department must continue working towards, specifically mentioning his own interests in focusing on ethics/social justice components of CS.

So I think, when you look at our mission and our values that are stated, a lot of that's in there, so we expect students to be able to write in our discipline. We expect students to be able to communicate within the discipline. We expect students to be able to take ideas of filling in different subjects and bring them into the classroom, but also take the ideas of computer science and extend them outside the classroom.

And so we do have a process every year where we decide which goal we are going to assess, and we come up with a process to do it. It's [a] direct assessment. So it's not surveys, it's actually looking at the curriculum. And so it could be that we look at exam questions that evaluate a certain concept that we expect all of our courses to teach, and we go through at the end of the year and evaluate how students did on those questions and their courses... I think we like to...we like to touch as many of our goals as possible. Some of them are more global goals and missions in our curriculum.” – Faculty B

So it's a really good opportunity for people who are outside of your department, people from around the country, you bring 3 to 5 people to campus. You write a self study. You do surveys of your students, alums and current students. You kind of look at the whole department, and you kind of offer it up to the external examiners to get them to think about ways that you might improve the Department. So that's coming up soon. So we'll definitely be getting a lot of student input in preparation for that, but most of the times when we're thinking about things, lately, it's been more just us kind of ... somebody will say, “I really think we should do x, y, or z,” and then we discuss it as a group.” – Faculty A

Faculty A has taught their Artificial Intelligence course integrating readings and discussions about AI’s application in society; Faculty B has co-taught a technology ethics course with a moral philosophy professor. It discusses the challenges of interdisciplinary collaboration, the expense of co-teaching, and student feedback on the need for more socially-contextualized, project-based experiences.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>For Faculty A, her experience in teaching socially and ethically conscious CS came via her AI course. When asked how the idea of implementing a social component came about, she stated that Computer Scientist Melanie Mitchell, whom she went to graduate school with, had started sending her drafts of what became a published and well-known book titled, <span style = "font-style: italic;">Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans</span>. Faculty A stated that the book “aligned with part of my world view of AI” and started having it be a required book for her AI course, upon her dissatisfaction with the more traditional AI textbooks that were circulated. While <span style = "font-style: italic;">Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans</span> is not a traditional textbook, it describes a more high-level, societally-focus analysis of the functionalities, myths, capabilities, and limitations of AI, and thus Faculty A had to explain the more technical aspects of the AI algorithms articulated in the book. She explained why she found exploring these issues important, exploring societal applications and implications, she argues, imbues AI a more nuanced, complex meaning:
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Faculty A valued discussion-based learning for these kinds of topics, and in hopes of encourage students to read and engage with the textbook, started implementing a reading response component to her course, and based on the responses, Faculty A believed “[the students] were really reading it, and they really connected to it and got something out of it and enjoyed it.” Because her AI course averages around 40 students, Faculty A also talked about challenges in navigating discussion-based components of the course, as students may not feel comfortable sharing in front of a high volume of students. Thus, Faculty A relegated to having students discuss in smaller groups with their neighbors and share with the rest of the class. As a strong proponent of collaborative learning, Faculty A also expressed her preference for project-based learning, where students are able to decide what topic/issue to pursue, as then, students obtain more personal ambitions in engaging with the discipline. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>For Faculty B, he had co-taught an Ethics and Technology course with a Swarthmore’s moral philosophy professor (whom I will reference as Professor Z) in the semester of Spring 2019.  Faculty B started conversing with Professor Z, expressing his frustrations regarding national conversations around AI, and upon further discussion, they had decided to try co-teaching a course about it. Faculty B was interested in Faculty Z’s work, but did not know much about philosophy, and visa versa. They believed that the experience of co-teaching a course that converges their respective expertise would also allow them to learn from another. Faculty B attributes the possibility of this cross-departmental collaboration to the culture of the college, which “encourages faculty from different disciplines to interact quite often, because if it was just a one time meeting it wouldn't have happened”.  They decided that the course would be a Freshman Year Seminar and have roughly six CS-oriented students and six philosophy-oriented students. Both faculty wanted the curriculum to not just explore case studies, which is the traditional approach within engineering-ethics courses, but to create more dynamic conversations with one another. The curriculum material drew from their former conversations about individual issues concerning ethics and technology and they were able to bring in their own perspectives and interests into the curriculum. Some of the topics that the course covered were Machine Learning and Algorithm Bias, AI, and Surveillance and Privacy.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Co-teaching a course is expensive, and requires each faculty to relinquish the courses they usually teach in the semester, and thus is hard to implement regularly. He also believes there may be hesitation from other faculty members to engage in a similar co-teaching, interdisciplinary course, which he would like to understand why:
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Because I had conducted the student interviews before the faculty interviews, I had an opportunity to inquire about their impressions of one salient aspect of the student responses, where both alumni wished there were more socially-contextualized, project-based experiences, which would have been a very beneficial experience and relevant to the post-graduate tech job they have. When I brought this up during the faculty interviews, they both acknowledged why such experiences were important, and how, in Faculty B’s words, “we haven't been able to necessarily provide as many of those opportunities as ... that we want.” While Faculty B believes that students should have multiple of those experiences, not all Group 3 application courses guarantee opportunities for such levels of engagement. Faculty B also discussed particular tradeoffs and other factors to consider when teaching socially-conscious projects, including sustaining a balance with “mak[ing] sure that we get the full spectrum of understanding the theoretical foundations and the applied side.” There are also challenges of having to adequately support and supervise different projects in a large class, like his ML class. Faculty B discusses how one way he circumvented this problem was that he had to limit the types of projects he approved for the course to manage all of them successfully.

What choices are we making without really even realizing that we're making them, and how they might affect us down the road.

In terms of the topics, we marched through and looked at the literature that was out there and tried to group them together…And so we came up with some themes that were philosophical to begin with, and then more algorithmic later on.” – Faculty B

                                        <li>Creating opportunities for students to engage with CS that reflects the kinds of post-grad work of research or industry has become a particular challenge after the CS major requirement revision in 2019, when amongst other things, the department had to eliminate the Senior Capstone course: a semester-long, collaborative, research and application based project situated within a particular real-world issue. Faculty B expressed that trying to have other courses fill in the gaps of the Senior Capstone has been difficult. While Faculty B believes that students should have multiple of those experiences, not all Group 3 application courses guarantee opportunities for such levels of engagement. Faculty B also discussed particular tradeoffs and other factors to consider when teaching socially-conscious projects, including sustaining a balance with “mak[ing] sure that we get the full spectrum of understanding the theoretical foundations and the applied side.”</li>
                                        <li>More often than not, areas of struggle stem from greater challenges facing the department as well as balancing with other duties as faculty. The faculty described other obligations they must fulfill each semester aside from teaching their designated classes, which included institutional service (being part of institutional committees, especially for tenured faculty), and student advising. Faculty also have more scholarship-driven responsibilities like attending conferences, reviewing papers, and giving talks about their area of expertise. Within the CS department, each faculty is also assigned specific departmental roles like running course lotteries, being in charge of the assessment for the year, hosting department panel events...etc. Senior CS faculty also advise junior CS faculty as well. Within the faculty’s departmental duties, the most notable task that both faculty explicitly mentioned was undertaking the arduous process of hiring more CS faculty to account for the rising number of students who become CS majors or minors at the college. Faculty A described the hiring process as something that consumes so much of the department, and doesn’t make way to attend to other areas of the department.</li>
                                        <li>Not all CS faculty feel strongly about the importance of socially and ethically conscious CS curriculum. Faculty A highlighted sources of disagreements amongst faculty on what components of CS pedagogy they felt were important to prioritize. In particular, there were some faculty members who wanted avenues to engage in CS more interdisciplinarily, especially on a societally critical level, creating relationships and sources of collaboration outside the department, whereas other faculty valued ensuring all the core components of CS were adequately addressed before stepping in that direction. She also mentioned how certain faculty, particularly older faculty, are less welcoming to course reform, which could seem like their expertise on how their course should be taught can be undermined. In navigating contentions or disagreements regarding identifying and approaching departmental reforms, both faculty stated how the department upholds the quaker values of the institution, and tries to reach a consensus as much as possible, and at least provide opportunities for everyone to voice their opinions. Faculty B expressed a desire to have these conversations more robustly as a department to be transparent about these ongoing initiatives to the students.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>This leads to other limitations of DEI initiatives within a discipline, in both academic and industry environments, that operates under structures of power primarily composed of white, cis men who also occupy the highest levels of power. Due to the dominant demographic of the CS faculty being white men, there are concerns on how departmental action and pedagogical conversations surrounding societal inequities occur. Furthermore, in Swarthmore College’s 2021 alumnus Miryam Ramirez Velazquez’s Computer Science and Educational Studies thesis, “Not Just Teaching How: Supporting a Culture Shift in STEM Education”, her research highlighted the lack of faculty preparation in critically reflecting on the purpose and efficacy of their pedagogical content and teaching methods.

But again, it's hit or miss, in terms of which courses actually have a project, or how much they move into that applied lens. And so I would definitely say it's a goal of the department that every student should have at least one. And actually multiple of those experiences. And our capstone course used to be that. We used to have a capstone course that students had to take. That was a project course, and I think we really struggled when we had to drop that course because we've tried to have our other courses lift up what was in that one culminating course, but it’s patchwork.” – Faculty B

We're still working on hiring. And so it really is unfortunate in that it limits what we can talk about anything else, and we would much rather be talking about assessment and thinking about curriculum...But there's not there's not as much conversation about what we're doing as all of us would like, to really think more deeply about what's going well, what could we improve on, what things do we want to add that we don't have.

So I think that's a tension that we struggle with because I think it's ...some of us feel how computer science contributes to society is really important, ... and that's something that seems that fits Swarthmore’s overarching goals. And whereas other people are like, “Well, we have to do computer science well, and that's the most important thing.” And so I do think that's something we go back and forth on a lot.” – Faculty A

These are issues that they have had to learn to deal with through their experiences as professors.” (Velazquez, 2021, p. 22-23).

It touches Faculty B's use of the embedded ethics model in their Machine Learning curriculum, the benefits of the newly established Teaching and Learning Center for cross-department faculty learning and collaboration, and Faculty A's external grant to co-teach an AI and Ethics course.

                                        <li>Faculty B wanted to utilize the success and outcomes of teaching the course and inquire, “how can we manage to keep these ideas going given all the other expectations that we have?” One idea Faculty B particularly discussed was the embedded ethics model, which as the name suggests, embeds conversations of ethics into the preexisting curriculum. Benefits of an embedded ethics model is that the department does not need faculty to teach a new, separate course. Faculty B implemented the embedded ethics model for each of his lab assignments the last time he taught Machine Learning, and believes there are ongoing initiatives where this model is being applied to other courses in the department, and ultimately hopes “to see it come into the introductory courses, and so on.”

                                        <li>Faculty A mentioned the Teaching and Learning Center – an initiative that started this year under the leadership of an Educational Studies professor at the college has a programmatic effort for educators to continue learning from and with one another. A space to have conversations across disciplines and departments on how to best improve their respective departments in terms of curricula, student retention, and interdisciplinary learning has been beneficial in continuing to have conversations on how to creatively include socially and ethically conscious pedagogy despite the bigger limitations.

                                        <li>Faculty A recently received a grant from the National Humanities Center to co-teach an AI and Ethics course with Professor Z. She emphasized that external resources outside the institution was a resource that allowed her to evade institutional challenges of co-teaching a course. Another beneficial aspect of receiving this grant was that Faculty A is part of a cohort of professors across institutions who also received grants to create new courses, and they meet once a month to share ideas, and to support each other trying new projects and initiatives.

So the idea of incorporating ethical conversations within our existing courses. I think there's a few advantages to this. For one, it doesn't require us to teach a new course. It doesn't require us to hire somebody to teach a new course. It doesn't require us to make a trade off there with dropping some course of handing in ...In putting this course in place there. – Faculty B

And the idea of embedding it within our courses means that you're seeing it multiple times throughout your career, and it's not- it's something that we think is- it should inform your thinking throughout the process of being a computer scientist. And so I've been able to do that. We did that the first- the last time I taught machine learning, we incorporated in each of the lab assignments, and then had a held-aside week for it. I know AI has done that, so I think that's an ongoing project to incorporate more of our courses. I'd like to see it come into the introductory courses. and so on.” – Faculty B

                                        “.. the idea of a teaching learning center is that it's a place where faculty all across the college could go and think about teaching in a meta way, right? How could I become a better teacher? How could I grade in a different way? How could I motivate students? How could I– come film me teaching and give me some feedback about how I'm doing. It's all those kinds of things wrapped up into one place. And so for many years this group, this committee, this Science Excellence Committee, was involved in pushing this, ‘We want a teaching and learning center. We think it would be beneficial to the college to have a teaching learning center’...So that's a way that we all are trying to think about how best to support students, to make science at Swarthmore welcoming and accessible to the broadest range of students possible. So there's all kinds of different things happening at the science level, thinking about excellence in science teaching, and how to be the best kind of science programs that we can have.” – Faculty A

And the other cool thing about it is there's 15 other institutions who are also inventing new courses, and we all meet once a month and talk to each other over zoom and share ideas. So none of them are computer scientists except for a few. And so I'm going to share some Python notebooks with them that they can use in their courses to show people what deep learning is, and things that, and they're sharing with me readings that I would never have thought about or known about that I could cover in my course. So I think that these big initiatives can really be important to moving people out of their comfort zones and trying new things, because you have all this support.” – Faculty A

The student interviewees recall their experiences in school and industry: the experiences of discrimination faced by women of color in CS lab environments, the reluctance to report such incidents to predominantly white, male faculty, the struggle to see values of diversity and social justice in the department, and the desire for faculty to address workplace power dynamics and support socially conscious conversations.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>As women of color in CS, both students shared their experience of being discriminated against and disrespected by their male counterparts within CS work environments. Student B shared an experience where a male lab partner took the keyboard away from her unannounced while she was typing on the computer. She remembers calling out the action specifically, but did not invoke concerns about gender discrimination to the lab partner or her professor, and just waited until a new lab partnership was put into rotation. This in turn, fostered values of respectful workplace dynamics and collaboration and the personal importance of seeking out workplaces with more women. Student A shared their experience working lab partnerships with male students, and how she aspired to strongly uphold her values when when managing employees within her current job.</li>
                                        <li>Both students described how when they would face discrimination within lab partnerships, they did not go to the course instructor about these issues. While faculty members mostly being white, cis, men rightfully attributes to marginalized students’s uncomfortability or distrust in safely and adequately having such experiences of discrimination addressed, Student A believes that if more of the faculty openly address issues related to marginality, she believes she would have been more comfortable having these conversations with her professors. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Values upholding careful consideration towards marginalized groups within CS was something Student A believed was hard to materially see within the department and the workplace. Rather, what was forefronted was values of efficiency, productivity, and novelty, instead of situating their work across various axioms of oppression or social justice causes. Thus, she had a difficult time finding friends or community with the other CS students in the department.</li>
                                        <li>For Student A, she wished that the faculty would have more conversations about structures of power within workplaces, as that was something that deeply affected her experience in tech work, and provide more general support navigating real-world work dynamics more. She also believed that if there were more socially and ethically oriented conversations, then she wouldn’t have stayed in those internships that she did “for that many years”. Her identities as a disabled, queer, women of color, her academic experience as an Environmental Science major, and her extracurriculars cultivated values of diversity, equity, inclusivity and social justice. Within her CS courses however, there was no discussion of relations of power and oppression, despite such topics being prevalent within the CS discipline. This allowed her to utilize her knowledge from her environmental science major to “[fill] in other parts that I could then apply to CS”. Her extracurricular work within the Tech for Social Good also provided opportunities to understand CS in different ways “specifically trying to expand what CS was within Swarthmore to something else”
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Not only are socially and ethically conscious curriculum significant for a more holistic, nuanced understanding of CS and its applications, addressing issues of social oppression and imbuing values of social responsibility are also deeply tied to diversity, equity and inclusion within the department. Both faculty interviewees acknowledge this, and found importance then, of bringing these issues into the forefront starting from the introductory course, as Faculty B says:</li>

                                    <div class = "grid-block">“...being a woman in tech is just different from the experience, I think it's very different, and maybe say, some of your other peers or coworkers. And I think it just pushes you to think more about your workplace environment and I just feel I’m more conscious of everything I do in the workplace, and how I interact with people and how I respond to people's questions, or how I talk to people. And so I think, just having that conscious mindset of always being aware of how I'm positioning myself in the workplace also has led me to be sort of more also focused on, say, what are the further implications of my own work, the skill based work that I'm doing. And so I think, just having already that mindset in place, also pushes me to think about other issues.” – student B</div>

So, I think from that perspective, we have had conversations about how their view ...they would- if we're interested in talking about attracting students from underrepresented backgrounds and making sure they feel represented, that these conversations can help with that.”

The ACM Curriculum 78 constructed a discipline standard composed of different programming principles and applications but failed to discern how to orient such components into rudimentary principles that underlie the discipline. Thus, critics of the ACM curriculum argued that the model failed to adequately discern what constituted CS as an educational discipline.", "On October 19, 1984, nine computer science professors representing nine liberal arts institutions came together to workshop a model curriculum that aimed to address the shortcomings of ACM Curriculum 78, while discussing how to integrate a robust computer science discipline within liberal arts institutions (Bruce et.al, 2001).", "With funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the LACS cohort would meet routinely in subsequent years to continue improving and expanding their efforts in creating guidelines for a liberal arts oriented computer science discipline. Such efforts led to LACS’s first publication in 1986, “A Model Curriculum for a Liberal Arts Degree in Computer Science”, that sought to define the fundamental principles of Computer Science as an academic and scientific discipline and drafted the first iteration of an undergraduate curriculum model derived from such principles.", "LACS published another paper in 1996 titled “A Revised Model Curriculum for a Liberal Arts Degree in Computer Science”, where two key changes were made to the previous iteration of the model curriculum.", "In 2007, LACS published another paper that built upon the 1996 model curriculum titled, “A 2007 Model Curriculum for a Liberal Arts Degree in Computer Science”."]

The exchange might facilitate research collaboration and perhaps make us more competitive in seeking research grants.<li>Could we offer a student exchange program? Given the small number of faculty in each of the schools, such a program could provide a greater opportunity for breadth for our students than any of our small liberals arts colleges could offer alone.</li><li>Could we define a reasonable basic set of laboratory facilities for computer science? How could we justify the need for laboratory facilities to colleagues and administrators who did not think of computer science as a laboratory science?</li><li>Could we collaborate in seeking grants and/or discounts to implement labs in our institutions? (Bruce et.al, 2001, pg. 2)</li></ul><strong>This gathering led to the formation of the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium (LACS), a cohort of computer scientists from liberal arts institutions aiming to advance the practices of teaching computer science within a liberal arts setting. </strong>", "The publication broadly defined computer science as a “coherent body of scientific principles that will continue to guide the discipline for the next decade or two, rather than allow it to be driven by the needs and priorities of particular technologies” (Gibbs, N. and Tucker, A., 1986, pg. 203). Thus, they argued that computer science is understood as a “systematic study of algorithms and data structures, specifically (1) their formal properties, (2) their mechanical and linguistic realizations, and (3) their applications.” (Gibbs, N. and Tucker, A., 1986, pg. 204). In setting precedence to the study of its formal properties, it positioned the discipline as a science. <br><br>The paper provided a curriculum framework modeled after this orientation constructed of two introductory courses (CS1 and CS2), four Core courses (CO1, CO2, CO3, and CO4), and three recommended supplemental math courses (Discrete Mathematics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra) (Gibbs, N. and Tucker, A., 1986). CS1 would effectively prepare students for the work required in the subsequent courses by covering foundational topics of program design and problem-solving through the introduction of a high-level programming language (Gibbs, N. and Tucker, A., 1986). It was recommended that CS1 curriculum touch upon particular skills integral to the succeeding courses like “divide- and-conquer algorithms, algorithm complexity, program invariants, and program verification.” (Gibbs, N. and Tucker, A., 1986, pg. 205). CS2 would provide an overview of the field by covering different data structures and their representations, searching and sorting data structures, systems software, and introducing concepts of unsolvable problems (Gibbs, N. and Tucker, A., 1986). The Core courses should address the theoretical foundations of the discipline of 1) Principles of Computer Organization, 2) Algorithms, 3) Theory of Computation and 4) Principles of Programming Languages (Gibbs, N. and Tucker, A., 1986). By compartmentalizing the discipline into six Computer Science courses and three Mathematics courses, each being a semester-long course (and after their completion, elective courses), students in a 4-year, B.A. degree program would not only have a strong grasp on the theoretical properties of the discipline, but also have room each semester to take courses from other disciplines — upholding a defining characteristic of a liberal arts education.", "The first was the integration of laboratory components within the two introductory courses (Walker, H. and Schneider, M., 1996). The second was the integration of multiple problem-solving paradigms (e.g. procedural, object-oriented, and functional paradigms) and multiple programming languages early in the model curriculum (Walker, H. and Schneider, M., 1996). This was to remediate a concern that if students focused on one problem-solving paradigm, they would have a harder time learning and adapting other paradigms needed for the higher level courses.", "One of the biggest changes developed in the 2007 model was the addition of a software development course that would formally and adequately support students in designing extensive projects within elective courses by covering topics like software design, design patterns, unit testing, and APIs (LACS, 2007)."]
